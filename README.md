4. In the top menu bar, select `Run` ... `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Robot Test Drive`
5. The robot will begin running, and you'll see the results of the run on your screen.

### Via RCC

Robocorp provides RCC as a CLI to run robots locally. To get started:

1. [Install RCC via these instructions](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc#installing-rcc-from-command-line)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder
3. Run this command to start your robot:
   ```bash
   rcc run
   ```

See the [RCC quickstart documentation](https://robocorp.com/docs/rcc/overview#quickstart) for more information.

### Via Python

No third party packages are needed for this challenge, so you can call `task.py` directly via Python to run your submission locally:

```
$ python3 task.py --help
usage: task.py [-h] input_file output_file

CLI to rank teams from a list of game results

positional arguments:
  input_file   Location of input CSV
  output_file  Location to write output CSV

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
```

**Note:** your submission will be run as a robot process via the [Robocorp framework](https://robocorp.com/docs/quickstart-guide) using Python 3.7.5. Please ensure that your submission is structured correctly according to [Robocorp‚Äôs documentation](https://robocorp.com/docs/setup/robot-structure).

### Robocorp Cloud
